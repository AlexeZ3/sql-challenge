Instructions
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site..

Data Engineering
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

CREATE TABLE "departments" (
    "dept_no" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "dept_name" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_departments" PRIMARY KEY (
        "dept_no"
     )
);

CREATE TABLE "employees" (
    "emp_no" INT   NOT NULL,
    "emp_title" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "birth_date" DATE   NOT NULL,
    "first_name" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "last_name" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "gender" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "hire_date" DATE   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_employees" PRIMARY KEY (
        "emp_no"
     )
);

CREATE TABLE "dept_emp" (
    "emp_no" INT   NOT NULL,
    "dept_no" VARCHAR   NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "dept_managers" (
    "dept_no" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "emp_no" INT   NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "salaries" (
    "emp_no" INT   NOT NULL,
    "salary" BIGINT   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_salaries" PRIMARY KEY (
        "salary"
     )
);

CREATE TABLE "titles" (
    "title_id" INT   NOT NULL,
    "title" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_titles" PRIMARY KEY (
        "title_id"
     )
);

Data Analysis
--1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
SELECT employees.emp_no, 
employees.last_name,
employees.first_name,
employees.gender,
salaries.salary
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN salaries
ON employees.emp_no = salaries.emp_no
ORDER BY emp_no


--2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE DATE_PART('year',hire_date) = 1986
ORDER BY emp_no;


--3. List the manager of each department along with their 
--department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
SELECT dept_managers.dept_no, 
departments.dept_name,
dept_managers.emp_no,
employees.last_name, 
employees.first_name
FROM dept_managers
LEFT JOIN departments
ON dept_managers.dept_no = departments.dept_no
LEFT JOIN employees 
ON dept_managers.emp_no = employees.emp_no
ORDER BY emp_no


--4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s 
--employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
SELECT
employees.emp_no,
employees.last_name,
employees.first_name,
dept_emp.dept_no,
departments.dept_name
FROM employees 
INNER JOIN dept_emp ON employees.emp_no=dept_emp.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments ON departments.dept_no=dept_emp.dept_no
order by emp_no;


--5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is 
--Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Hercules' AND last_name like 'B%';


--6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
SELECT 
employees.emp_no, 
employees.last_name, 
employees.first_name,
dept_emp.dept_no
FROM employees 
LEFT JOIN dept_emp 
ON employees.emp_no=dept_emp.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments 
ON departments.dept_no=dept_emp.dept_no
WHERE departments.dept_name='Sales';


--7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, 
--including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
SELECT 
employees.emp_no, 
employees.last_name, 
employees.first_name,
dept_emp.dept_no
FROM employees 
LEFT JOIN dept_emp 
ON employees.emp_no=dept_emp.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments 
ON departments.dept_no=dept_emp.dept_no
WHERE departments.dept_name in ('Sales', 'Development')


--8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names 
--(that is, how many employees share each last name).
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) AS freq_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY last_name
ORDER BY freq_count DESC;
